# Local Minihack Lab with Vagrant
These are instructions for running a script that will **automatically setup a local environment with several Virtualbox VMs which closely match the NCAE Minihack environment**.

This enables the following:

- Practice without cloud access / internet.
- You can test your external internet config within the system as you might on game day.
- Makes the user experience smoother.


# Installation
> [!tip]+ Dependencies ⭐
>  You will need **Virtualbox**, **Vagrant**, and the **Ruby programming language**. I have included links / instructions for setting these up on each platform below.
>  
> You can follow OS-specific advice below, or check out [https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) if those instructions aren't working for some reason.

## Windows
- **Virtualbox** → [https://www.oracle.com/virtualization/technologies/vm/downloads/virtualbox-downloads.html](https://www.oracle.com/virtualization/technologies/vm/downloads/virtualbox-downloads.html)
- **Vagrant** → [https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/install?product_intent=vagrant](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/install?product_intent=vagrant)
- **Ruby** →[https://rubyinstaller.org/](https://rubyinstaller.org/)
	- Or check out [https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/)

## Linux
- **Virtualbox** → Package manager, or [https://www.oracle.com/virtualization/technologies/vm/downloads/virtualbox-downloads.html](https://www.oracle.com/virtualization/technologies/vm/downloads/virtualbox-downloads.html)
- **Vagrant** → [https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/install?product_intent=vagrant](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/install?product_intent=vagrant)
- **Ruby** → Download it from your package manager
	- Or check out [https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/)

## MacOS
- **Virtualbox** → [https://www.oracle.com/virtualization/technologies/vm/downloads/virtualbox-downloads.html](https://www.oracle.com/virtualization/technologies/vm/downloads/virtualbox-downloads.html)
- **Vagrant** → [https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/install?product_intent=vagrant](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/install?product_intent=vagrant)
- **Ruby** → You must have the Homebrew (**`brew`**) package manager. Install it with this command: `brew install ruby`
	- **`brew`** package manager: https://brew.sh/
	- Or check out [https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/)

## After installing required dependencies...

**You have two options for obtaining the script / vagrantfile:**
1. Download the zip of the repository and unpack it: [https://github.com/reg1z/Local-Minihack](https://github.com/reg1z/Local-Minihack) **OR**
2. Clone the repo with git: `git clone https://github.com/reg1z/Local-Minihack`

> [!warning]+ Notice!
> > ==**GUI** IS THE ONLY WORKING FLAVOR RIGHT NOW==
>
> **There are ~~2~~ 1 flavors of the script you can use: **
> 1. **GUI** - Mimics the "Minihack" environment.
> 	- Run `vagrant up` from the **"GUI"** directory if you want access to the desktop environments of each machine.
> 2. ~~**Headless** - Mimics the game day environment (allegedly) - ***WARNING: WIP MAY NOT WORK***~~
> 	- ~~Run `vagrant up` from the **"Headless"** directory if you prefer access only via SSH. Desktop environments will not be accessible by default.~~
> 	- ~~In it's current state, may require some tinkering with Virtualbox settings to work~~
> 
> 💥 ***Keep in mind, the whole process of downloading and importing all VMs can take 10 - 30 minutes!*** 💥


### **Windows**

1. Open a PowerShell console as Administrator and navigate to the unpacked code repository you downloaded from GitHub.
2. Choose your flavor **GUI** or **Headless** and cd into the corresponding directory.
3. Run `vagrant up`. As long as you have the required dependencies everything should work.
4. Wait for Vagrant to download and configure each VM.
	- ==DO NOT MESS WITH ANY OF THE VMs THAT POP UP UNTIL YOUR MICROTIK ROUTER IS UP==
	- It may take some time for the Ubuntu server to get set up completely.
5. If Vagrant yells at you about not being able to finish configuration for the Microtik router (vm4), ignore it.
6. Your environment is ready! You can shut it all off with `vagrant halt` and turn it on again with `vagrant up`

### **Linux and MacOS**

1. Open a Terminal and navigate to the unpacked code repository you downloaded from GitHub.
2. Choose your flavor **GUI** or **Headless** and cd into the corresponding directory.
3. Run `vagrant up`.
4. Wait for Vagrant to download and configure each VM.
	- ==DO NOT MESS WITH ANY OF THE VMs THAT POP UP UNTIL YOUR MICROTIK ROUTER IS UP==
	- It may take some time for the Ubuntu server to get set up completely.
5. If Vagrant yells at you about not being able to finish configuration for the Microtik router (vm4), ignore it.
6. Your environment is ready! You can shut it all off with `vagrant halt` and turn it on again with `vagrant up`. You can tinker with the settings of each VM as you deem necessary.

> [!tip]+ Login Info
> - The Ubuntu and Kali boxes are configured with the same info as the Minihack
> 	- **user:** sandbox
> 	- **password**: password
> - The Microtik router will have no existing configurations
> 	- You will need to login with the username "admin" and provide your own password

# To Start Fresh

> [!tip]+ If you screw up the environment and want to wipe it clean...
> > ***==NOTE: You shouldn't have to re-download your boxes after the first-time setup.==***
> 
> **From the directory you ran `vagrant up` in, run:**
> - `vagrant destroy -f` ← (***forces*** shutdown + deletion automatica lly)
> - **OR** `vagrant destroy` ← (***manually*** confirm deletion of each VM)
> - This will immediately stop and delete all VMs vagrant has set up using the current vagrantfile
> 
> **To re-create the environment:**
> - Just run `vagrant up` again
