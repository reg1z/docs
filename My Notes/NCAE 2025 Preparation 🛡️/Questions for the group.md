# Questions for the group

## Locations

### ENCRYPTION - ðŸš¨
- SSH â†’ Where do we want to store SSH keys
	- Log aggregation server? 5 different private keys? Each in different locations?
	- Where on individual hosts?
- Logs â†’ Where to store OpenSSL encryption keys + init vectors?
	- They will have to be on every logged endpoint.
	- Or should we just do pull-based logging
