> *When calculating amortized runtime, your goal is to compare the total cost of a series of operations with how many of those operations happened. The intuition here is that you want to “build up enough credit” with a series of cheap operations, so that when you have one (or more) expensive operations, you can average out the cost of the expensive one.*
