# WGU Resources
When I started WGU, I found it difficult to fully comprehend all the resources the school provides.

You can find many of these links on the Student Portal through the "Student Success Centers," but I found this process to be somewhat disjointed and maze-like. So, I've aggregated all of those I could find here!


## Student Resources
The same day your degree program begins, you'll have access to *many* impactful resources that can be expensive on their own. All of these are included alongside your degree program at no extra cost.


> [!tip]+ Tip - Other Perks
> Apart from WGU, you are now considered an "enrolled student" in the eyes of many businesses – there are numerous credits and discounts you now have access to!
> 
> It's worth exploring the offerings of different vendors to get a bigger picture of all the resources available to you. You can find good deals using search engines, seeking tips from other student on sites like reddit, etc.

## Alumni Resources
Many graduates are unaware of the free access they have to certain resources even after graduation!
