# About

This is my personal website. A place for research and study, personal pragmatism emphasized. Though, hopefully I've left a few useful things for you. You can find my blog, miscellaneous notes, and anything else I've found noteworthy.

It's meant to be a window into my head for both others *and myself* to peak through. Apart from brain surgery, there are few alternatives.

This is the first in many experiments of mine to [Learn in Public](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IE94ZZo6IVw). If you notice something's wrong, please reach out. Really, I'd appreciate the chance to improve.

And wouldn't it be great if we both ended up learning something along the way?
